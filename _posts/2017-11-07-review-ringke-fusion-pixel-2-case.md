In the midst of a new phone on the market, I'm sure you've asked the same questions I have: 

* "Which case would work well with this phone?"
* "Should I go with a previous brand?"
* "Do I want to try something new?"
* "Hmm, what is Google offering in their store...Holy $*(@ that's expensive!"

After reviewing the popular brands, I decided to get the [Ringke Fusion](http://amzn.to/2zr0jOH) case. I figure I would spend the least amount of money now and wait until the reviews come in for the cases I'm interested in. While there are other cases that are cheaper, I wanted to ensure my purchase would not be a regretful decision. This case is only a few bucks more than the cheaper versions anyway. On to the review!

# Weight

* 24g - Ringke Case
* 142g - Pixel 2

One of my peeves when getting a case is having a lightweight device get weighed down by the case protecting it (I'm looking at you iPad!). Thankfully, this case is pretty lightweight. As you can see, it only adds ~15% more weight than before and you can't even really tell the difference. +1.

# Feel

* Side-buttons are soft and feel better than the standard buttons
* Screen-facing plastic has a rigid feel which provides a grip for holding the phone
* The edges which fuse the back panel and the soft TPU plastic are rough and don't make the case feel seamless.
* Back panel has decent grip but can get slippery with over time

I was first interested in the [Incipio Carnaby](http://amzn.to/2zadGzK) and [Google Fabric](https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_2_case_fabric?hl=en-US) cases because of their fabric material. But after day-to-day usage for about 2 weeks now, I would say that it works well for me. The surrounding plastic is soft and flexible which feels comfortable on the hand. When you need to hold tight, the ridges provide extra grip without tapping on the screen. Initially, I liked the feel of the back panel. Over time, it now feels like a piece of generic plastic. 80% of the time I'm holding the phone with the edges anyway so it's not huge issue.

# Appearance

* Smoke color hides the case well with Just Black color.
* Case adds a hook to enable the ability to personalize or attach your phone to a [wrist strap](http://amzn.to/2z9emVR).
* The gaps for the camera and fingerprint have gaps for particulates to enter.
* Back panel is a fingerprint magnet 

There's a lot of talk about how these TPU cases will yellow over time so I went with the Smoke Black color. I'm surprised how it blended with the case's color. If your phone is facing up, it looks seamless. My only complaint is the back panel does look like a clear case surrounding a phone.

# Overall 

**4/5**

I'm impressed with this case. I would recommend it to anyone looking for something minimal and lightweight. Having the case still feels like you're holding your Pixel 2 and not a shell with a phone inside. There's enough protection to handle a drop without being intrusive and bulky. I'm still considering the [Google Fabric](https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_2_case_fabric?hl=en-US) case but for now, I'm going to stick with my [Ringke Fusion](http://amzn.to/2zr0jOH).
